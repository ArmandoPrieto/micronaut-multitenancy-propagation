The Micronaut HTTP server supports the ability to apply filters to request/response processing in a similar, but reactive, way to Servlet filters in traditional Java applications.

Create a filter to redirect to `/tenant` if you attempt to access `/` without a cookie. That it is to say, in a situation where the application is not able to resolve the tenant ID.
